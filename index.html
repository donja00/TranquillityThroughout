	<h2>Information Regarding Mental Health</h2>
	<h3> Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. <br><br>
    Through our platform, we aim to give more insight into different forms of mental health but we want to focus on three main ones that commonly occur in day to day life.</h3>

	<h2> Depression</h2>
		<div class="text-center">
		<img src="images/depression300.jpg" class="img-fluid " alt="An illustration of a rain cloud in a head"></div><br>
	<h3> Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.<br><br>

Depression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:
<ul>
<li>Feeling sad or having a depressed mood</li>
<li>Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed</li>
<li>Changes in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting</li>
<li>Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much</li>
<li>Loss of energy or increased fatigue</li>
<li>Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing)</li>
<li>Feeling worthless or guilty</li>
<li>Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions</li>
<li>Thoughts of death or suicide </li>
	</ul></h3>
	<br>

	<h2> Generalized Anxiety Disorder</h2>
		<div class="text-center">
		<img src="images/anxiety300.jpg" class="img-fluid " alt="An illustration of someone worrying a lot"></div><br>
	<h3> Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by excessive, uncontrollable and often irrational worry about events or activities. This excessive worry often interferes with daily functioning, and sufferers are overly concerned about everyday matters such as health issues, money, death, family problems, friendship problems, interpersonal relationship problems, or work difficulties. <br><br>

Anxiety symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:
<ul>
<li>Excessive worry</li>
<li>Restlessness</li>
<li>Trouble sleeping</li>
<li>Feeling tired</li>
<li>Irritability</li>
<li>Sweating</li>
<li>Trembling</li>
	</ul></h3>
	<br>
	
	<h2> Bipolar Disorder</h2>
		<div class="text-center">
		<img src="images/bipolar300.jpg" class="img-fluid " alt="An illustration of someone showing two moods"></div><br>
	<h3> Bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression) is a mental disorder that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, concentration, and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. There are three types of bipolar disorder. All three types involve clear changes in mood, energy, and activity levels. <br><br>
	<ul>
	<li>Bipolar I Disorder<br> 
		Defined by manic episodes that last at least 7 days, or by manic symptoms that are so severe that the person needs immediate hospital care. Usually, depressive episodes occur as well, typically lasting at least 2 weeks. Episodes of depression with mixed features (having depressive symptoms and manic symptoms at the same time) are also possible.</li>
	<li>Bipolar II Disorder
		<br>
		Defined by a pattern of depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes, but not the full-blown manic episodes that are typical of Bipolar I Disorder.</li>
	<li>Cyclothymic Disorder (also called Cyclothymia)<br>
		Defined by periods of hypomanic symptoms as well as periods of depressive symptoms lasting for at least 2 years (1 year in children and adolescents). However, the symptoms do not meet the diagnostic requirements for a hypomanic episode and a depressive episode.</li>	
		</ul></h3>

	<h2><strong>If experiencing any of these symptoms for more than 2 weeks, it is advised to contact your general practitioner.</strong></h2>
